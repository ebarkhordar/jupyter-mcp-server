"""Tasks: a call whose answer outlives the request that asked for it.

Running a cell can take ten minutes. A client that has to hold a connection
open for those ten minutes loses the work when the laptop sleeps, and a client
that gives up waiting has no way to find out what happened. Tasks are the
protocol's answer: `tools/call` returns a **task id** immediately, the work
goes on, and the client asks for the result whenever it likes — from another
connection, after a reconnect, tomorrow.

MCP defines this. `mcp.types` carries `Task`, `TaskStatus`, `CreateTaskResult`
and the `tasks/*` request shapes; what the SDK does not yet do is *route* the
methods, so this binds them as an extension. `TASKS_EXTENSION` is one
constant, and the day the SDK routes `tasks/*` itself this file loses its
`methods()` and keeps everything else.

Three rules, and most of the code is one of them.

**A task is created only when the client asks for one.** `tools/call` carries
`task` metadata when the client wants a task. Without it the call is
synchronous, exactly as before. Turning a synchronous call into a task
because the server thought it would be slow would break every client that
does not know what a task id is — they would read `CreateTaskResult` as the
tool's output.

**A failure is a failed task, not an empty one.** A tool that raised must end
`failed` carrying the error. The alternative — `completed` with no output —
is the worst outcome available: the client believes the work succeeded and
produced nothing.

**A task nobody can see is gone, not empty.** An expired task answers "no
such task" rather than a record with no result. A client that reads an empty
result as "it produced nothing" is wrong in a way it cannot detect.
