"""Cancelling threw away the thing cancelling was supposed to preserve.

`tasks/cancel` interrupted the work and then cancelled the coroutine waiting
for it, in the same breath. Once the interrupt actually worked, that became a
race the output always lost: the interrupt makes the kernel raise, the tool's
own completion path collects what the cell printed and writes it to the
notebook and the result — and `handle.cancel()` arriving first kills the tool
before any of that runs.

Measured on prod1 on 2026-09-07, with a working interrupt and before this
fix: a cell printing every two seconds, cancelled after twenty, answered
`tasks/result` with **no content at all**, and `read_cell` showed the cell
with no outputs and no execution count. The same cell left to finish shows
all eight lines in both places, so the outputs were never the problem — the
moment they were collected was.

So the cancel now gives an interrupted tool a bounded moment to hand back
what it has, and only then cancels it. The status is still `cancelled`: the
client asked for that, and how the work ended does not change what it asked.

Launch the tests:
```
$ pytest tests/test_a_cancelled_cell_hands_back_what_it_printed.py -v
```
